> A React component for viewing Jest tests in the browser

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-jest-test-viewer.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jest-test-viewer) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```bash
npm install react-jest-test-viewer
```

## Usage

This package will display HTML test reports generated by
[`jest-html-reporter`](https://github.com/Hargne/jest-html-reporter/) in the
browser alongside your React app. First, you'll need a configuration file to
output the test results to the `public` directory. Make a file called
`jesthtmlreporter.config.json`, and put in these options:

```json
{
  "pageTitle": "Test Report",
  "outputPath": "public/test.html",
  "includeFailureMsg": true
}
```

Next, when running tests, you'll need to tell Jest to use `jest-html-reporter`
as a reporter:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "test": "react-scripts test --reporters jest-html-reporter default --watchAll"
}
```

It's recommended to run `npm test` in one terminal window, and `npm start` in
another, so that your tests will be watched and run in the background; and your
app will be hot-reloaded in the browser.

To display the component:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import TestViewer from 'react-jest-test-viewer'
import App from './App'

ReactDOM.render(
  <TestViewer
    active={process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'}
    showTests={true}
    testFile='test.html'
  >
    <App />
  </TestViewer>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```
